**FFmpeg** is used to compress the rendered MOV into an MP4 but **Mac OS** will ask for your approval before running it the first time so you might see this error.

After locating **FFmpeg** inside of Anubis extension, right-click or control-click to open it. This is different from doubling clicking and will show a new popup with the option to `Open` it. Click `Open` and **Terminal** should then launch and show a bunch of info about FFmpeg in the command line. 

Close **Terminal** and ***Anubis*** should be ready to export MP4s.

**SHIFT-click** the main icons in the Ae Anubis panel to open a Finder window revealing FFmpeg within the extension â€“instead of digging through your hard drive to find the installed extension.
