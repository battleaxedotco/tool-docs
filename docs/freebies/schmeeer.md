Because the [Echo effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2qxF8V57FE) doesn't always make sense. Work with echo's more intuitively and by dynamically adding frames and adjusting the length based on the on-screen motion of a layer.

Dynamic smearing is driven by the on-screen motion in *position*, *rotation*, *scale* and even *parented* movement.

- **Smear length**: How far do you want to smear? 
  - 100% will be the full distance between the current and previous frame
  - 50% will be half the distance between the current and previous frame
- **Distance threshold**: How far does a layer need to move before the smears start?
  - Layer movement less than the threshold (in pixels) will not have smears applied. 
  - *Note:* Smears are cool, but they are typically impactful because of a contrast between smeared and non-smeared frames. Smearing everything can make things look too smooshy, but it's your project. Do whatever you want. 
- **Count multiplier**: Increase this value if you notice stepping on the smears. Be careful because this value is multiplying the the number of echoes. 
- **Echo effect**: You can probably leave alone unless you know what you're doing
