# Getting started

<img :src="$withBase('/overlord/header.gif')" alt="Overlord header">

Whether you draw your own illustrations and spend hours prepping Illustrator files for import, or work alongside a team and constantly have to remind designers how to split art onto layers, there is a smarter way to work. 

Illustrator and After Effects should feel like companion applications, not rivals. Let each app's strength compliment the other. Let Illustrator become a plugin for After Effects.

Work with shapes, not files.

### Selections

Select what you need and transfer it as you need it rather than spend all day splitting out layers for what you think you might need. 

Art is messy business and having to stop down to prep files for Ae import can kill the energy of a project. Shapes may be pulled from any Ai layer as needed.

### Organization

This is, for the first time, totally optional. Feel free to transfer what you need and rename the Ae layers.

But if you prefer to keep those layers tidy, Overlord will also transfer naming so all your hard work wont be lost with a **Convert to Shape Layers**.
