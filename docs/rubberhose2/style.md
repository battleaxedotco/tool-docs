## Applying styles
Select a layer (hose or controller) from the desired hose group, select a style from the style library, and press the Apply button. The current style will be removed and the new one applied.

## Copy/paste style
Customized styles may be saved and added to the library (see below), but the quickest way to get a style on another hose is to copy. Select a layer (hose or controller) and press **Style Copy**. Select a layer from the desired hose group and press **Style Paste** to overwrite the current style. Holding the Shift key will paste the new style to the existing without overwriting.

## Saving styles

Select a layer (hose or controller) that belongs to the style you would like to save. Hold **ALT** and click the **Copy Style** button. A file save dialog will popup. Save the file to your desktop or somewhere easy to locate. When you press **Save** you will likely be presented with a similar warning about the save location being outside of the default.  AE just wants you to know that the preset won't be available in the Effects & Presets panel. We don't want it there so click OK to ignore this error.

## Installing a style

Whether you created and saved your own Style Preset or downloaded on for another user, the installation is the same. Click the small **folder** button to open the Styles folder. Drag or copy the desired file into the folder. In order to update the library list in the RubberHose 2 script panel click the **Refresh** button. The list will update and you can apply your new styles all day long.

## Tips

### Factory reset
Know that before [resetting the script](./manage.html#reset-everything) and all of its settings, that all style presets will also be reset to the factory default. Be sure to save a copy of custom styles before resetting.

### Version compatibility
Be aware that when saving presets for sharing with others the Ae version you are currently using from will be the lowest version that may apply the preset. To save a CC2020 style for use with users on CC2019, you will first have to (File>Save As>Save a Copy as [lower version]â€¦). Open the newly saved project file then repeat the Style Preset saving process inside of the lower version.


### Locked hose
Styles may still be applied to hose layers that are locked. This is helpful if you enable Lock Hose at Creation in the script [settings](./manage.html#settings) (to avoid accidental selection when animating).
