# Hose / controller settings

<Video url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNkUD5dboJs" />

Every new hose will use the values in the **Settings** group to define the:

- Hose length
- Realism
- Bend slide
- Bend roundness
- Bend direction
- Controller colors
- Controller size
- Controller stretch feedback
- Controller pair naming options


### Get/apply settings

Settings are often *set-and-forget*, but in Rubberhose you have the freedom to push and pull settings from hoses almost like a global copy and paste.

**Stretch feedback** is the one exception to pushing and pulling. With this option disabled the expression is excluded so the option only effects new hoses.

### Get selected hose settings

Select a hose or controller and batch pull all the hose 5 hose properties.

### Apply all hose settings

Batch apply all 5 hose properties to:

- The selected hose
- All hoses in the comp with no layers selected


### Reset the defaults

After editing for a while it is easy to forget where we started. Right click the panel to **Reset default settings**.
