## Why aren’t controllers auto-rotating?

TLDR: It’s gone. But [hose parenting](./manage.html#parent-to-hose) has increased accuracy and renders faster. You can still parent a layer to a controller, but it will not auto-rotate.

Context: Rubberhose 2 introduced the concept of controller rotation to the world of rigging, and it revolutionized how hands and feet attached to limbs. It was a cool feature, but required a lot of redundant math to allow controllers to define a curve, then the curve defined the controller rotation.

## Where is RubberPin?

It’s gone. Adobe has made a series of changes to their Puppet Pins system that improve usability in many ways. Unfortunately, it is currently very difficult to distort a layer in a Rubberhose-like way using pins.

If the Puppet tool is a part of your workflow, jump on Discord and help us make sense of how this could work with Rubberhose 3.
