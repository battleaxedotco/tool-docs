## Options

### Add timestamp to render filename

Adobe apps do a lot behind the scenes to cache what you need, but sometimes they fail to update when you replace footage. If you find that your renders fail to update, enable timestamps for the exporting app. Exported files will have a timestamp added to the end so the importing app sees it as a fresh file. 

The timestamp is made up of 2 digits for the year, month, date, hour, minute, second. 

`2020, July 30, 3:37:30pm` becomes `LayerName_200730-153730.swf`

### Tooltips
This one is personal preference. No judgment either way.

### Render to Ae project file path
The same control as on the [After Effects](./transfer.html#manual-export-path) panel.
