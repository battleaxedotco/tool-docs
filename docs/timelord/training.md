# Animation training

Traditional animation isn't something you can just watch a tutorial about. It's a deep set of principles that take time, but thankfully there are masters who share their knowledge to help you learn and grow. 

These are not Timelord tutorials â€“animation principles are way bigger than Timelord. These are some of the best ways to step up your own animation skills.

[Henrique's](https://henriquebarone.com/) work is mind-blowing, and his ability to share his process is such a benefit to anyone willing to put in the time.

The energy of [Johannes'](https://www.instagram.com/johanimation) animation is inspiring, and his courses are more than worth a Skillshare membership.

As an artist on [Kipo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25UHUbpFTtY) (one of my favorite animated shows) and many of your favorite shows and films, [Toniko's](https://www.tonikopantoja.com/) production knowledge is second to none. This training series is massive. 

Bonus: the [tips section](https://www.tonikopantoja.com/tips) of his site is a goldmine.
