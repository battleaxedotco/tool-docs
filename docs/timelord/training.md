# Animation training

Traditional animation isn't something you can just watch a tutorial about. It's a deep set of principles that take time, but thankfully there are masters who share their knowledge to help you learn and grow. 

These are not Timelord tutorials –animation principles are way bigger than Timelord. These are some of the best ways to step up your own animation skills.

The energy of [Johannes'](https://www.instagram.com/johanimation) animation is inspiring, and his courses are more than worth a Skillshare membership.

As an artist on [Kipo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25UHUbpFTtY) (one of my favorite animated shows) and many of your favorite shows and films, [Toniko's](https://www.tonikopantoja.com/) production knowledge is second to none. This training series is massive.
