# Troubleshooting

## FFmpeg missing on macOS

If you see `ffmpeg.exe` but not a `ffmpeg` OSX app, then it failed to install correctly.

Unfortunately the FFmpeg app sometimes get skipped when installing the extension. Try uninstalling in ZXP Installer and doing a [manual install](./#installation) by copying the whole extension folder.
